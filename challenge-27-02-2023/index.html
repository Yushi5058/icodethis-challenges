          <p class="title-paragraph">Being lucky in life is the result of putting yourself into action for good luck to happen to you. You've probably heard the statement
            "The harder I work the luckier I get". Another way of putting it is "Whatever you are ready for is ready for you" 
          </p>
          <p class="title-paragraph">Are you statisfied with your life, the job you have, or the amount of money you're making? Or are you not satisfied with
            the feeling that life is somehow passing you by? Chances are one of these reasons fits you because most people aren't satisfied with their lives, and usually one of those reasons is the cause.
          </p>
          <p class="title-paragraph">Success is not a spectator sport, something that just happens before your eyes, it's an experience, a game that must be played to be enjoyed fully. You need to get involved with life. You'll need to get more involved with your family, friends,
            people you see every day. Because in that involvement, you'll find you have everything you need to succeed.
          </p>
          <p class="title-paragraph">You have within you, right now, at this very moment, all that is necessary for you to become the happy, successful
            person you've always wanted to be. All you need to do is unlock the riches that have been locked away with-in you.
          </p>
          <p class="title-paragraph">Are you ready for a more abundant and happier life? If you are, then you'll need to know how to put yourself into action
            to achieve it. Consider these discoveries for successful living.
