# ABOUT

UI / UX design practice challenges to enhance my design skills on vanilla css
(tailwindcss, begin: 11/05/2023), challenges are brought
by [icodethis](https://www.icodethis.com/) website.
I learn everyday about UI / UX design, feel free to provide some feedback
by raising an issue.

# TECH STACK 

HTML and CSS, Tailwindcss (begin: 11/05/2023)

# LIVE PREVIEW

There is no live preview. All the challenges are listed [here](https://www.icodethis.com/yushi_61)

# NOTE

<code>*The challenges are not responsive, only working in a laptop screen
or a screen width of 1360px minimum. I do these challenges to progress in web
design skills, responsive is a design skill but I don't bother with it since 
the challenges are made for a wide screen preview, hope you understand that.*</code>

The challenges beginning after 10/05/2023 are using Tailwindcss. They must be 
responsive, so if you see them unresponsive. Don't hesitate to open an issue.

Thanks for reading,
Yushi
